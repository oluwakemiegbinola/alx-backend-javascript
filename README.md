Node.js: Node.js is a runtime environment that allows code to run JavaScript on the server-side. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient for building scalable network applications. With Node.js, one can build web servers, APIs, and other server-side applications entirely in JavaScript.

Deno: Deno is a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript built on V8, the same JavaScript engine as Node.js. It was created by the same person who originally created Node.js. Deno aims to provide a more secure and modern alternative to Node.js, with built-in support for TypeScript, a more secure runtime environment, and a standard library that doesn't rely on a package manager.

Express.js: Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It provides a simple and minimalistic set of tools for building web applications and APIs. Express.js is unopinionated, which means it gives you the flexibility to structure your application in any way you want.

NestJS: NestJS is a framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications in TypeScript. It's built on top of Express.js and heavily inspired by Angular. NestJS provides a modular and organized structure for your applications, making it easy to manage complex projects.
