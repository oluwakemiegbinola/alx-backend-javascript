TypeScript

TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript, which means that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, enabling developers to catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime. This can lead to more robust code and better tooling support, especially in larger codebases.

Some key features of TypeScript include:

Static Typing: TypeScript allows developers to define types for variables, function parameters, return values, and more. This helps catch type-related errors during development.

Interfaces and Type Declarations: TypeScript allows developers to define custom types using interfaces, enums, classes, and other constructs, providing powerful ways to model data structures.

Type Inference: TypeScript's type inference system automatically infers types when they are not explicitly specified, reducing the need for explicit type annotations and making the code more concise.

Type Annotations: Developers can explicitly annotate types to provide additional clarity and documentation in their code.

ES6+ Features: TypeScript supports modern JavaScript features, including those from ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and later, allowing developers to take advantage of the latest language enhancements.

Compatibility: TypeScript code can be compiled down to plain JavaScript, making it compatible with all JavaScript environments.

Tooling Support: TypeScript has excellent tooling support, including integration with popular editors like Visual Studio Code, as well as build tools and linters
